# Overview

The software is a command-line menu-driven application that allows the user to interact with the Firebase Realtime Database. It integrates with the database using the Firebase Admin SDK and enables the user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the database.

To use the program, the user needs to provide the appropriate inputs according to the menu prompt displayed on the command-line interface. The user can create a row by providing name, age, and email, update a row by providing the row ID and the new name, age, and email, delete a row by providing the row ID, and list all the rows from the database. The program displays the results on the command-line interface.

# Cloud Database

The code uses the Firebase Realtime Database as the cloud database. Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that stores data in JSON format and synchronizes data in real-time between connected clients.

The database created in the code has a single table named "users". The table has rows that contain information about users, including name, age, and email. Each row in the table has a unique ID generated by Firebase. The database structure is relatively simple, with a single table and three fields per row. However, the structure can be expanded upon by adding additional tables and fields as needed.

# Future Work

- Improve the Menu experience so that ids are presented as smaller numbers
- Expand functionality to allow other tables to be made and edited
- Create more functions so that the user can gather useful info from the table
